    "# Comparing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B with TinyLlama for Reasoning Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I compared two compact language models: **DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 1.5B** and **TinyLlama**. Both models can run on CPUs. DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 1.5B, a recent release, emphasizes enhanced reasoning capabilities achieved through reinforcement learning techniques. TinyLlama, an open-source model, offers a balance between performance and resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate their reasoning abilities, I present each model with three distinct tasks, each targeting a different aspect of reasoning. After obtaining their responses, I perform a comparative analysis to assess their strengths and limitations in handling these tasks. This evaluation aims to provide insights into the practical applications and effectiveness of these models in reasoning scenarios. "
